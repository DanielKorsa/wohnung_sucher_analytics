# Data Analysis of 2020 ImmmobilienScout24 Rental Apartment Data

## Background story

In Sep 2020 we started looking for a new apartment to rent in Munich - (which is one of the hardest cities to find a flat). I made a set up on AWS and coded a Telegram Bot to get the latest offers asap.
At some point I had quite some data and wanted to get some insights on rental situation cuz there was not too much meaningful researchers out there.
